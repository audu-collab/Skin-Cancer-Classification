ResNet50 is a pre-trained neural network architecture that has been used for skin cancer classification. It consists of layers such as convolution layer, batch normalization, max pooling, and ReLu activation layer. The model is trained on dermoscopic images collected from the HAM10000 dataset, and it classifies the images into 7 different types of skin lesions. In some studies, ResNet50 has been compared with other models like VGG-16, Densenet, Mobilenet, Inceptionv3, and Xception to classify different types of skin lesions. Despite its effectiveness, the accuracy of ResNet50 can be influenced by factors like data preprocessing, data augmentation methods, and class imbalance within the dataset.

The dataset in this project was not balanced due to time constraints.
